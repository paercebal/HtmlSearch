# HtmlSearch

A quick way to replace thee olde olde Firefox Search uber combobox

## Quick start

HtmlSearch already comes with some default search engines configured, so, all
you have to do is to open the index.html page in a browser, and enjoy.

## TODO

Document how to add/customize search engines.
